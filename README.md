# ADMIN DASHBOARD (Using CSS Grid)

## Introduction
This project showcases my ability to build a full dashboard design using CSS Grid for the majority of the layout work. The goal was to structure and style a dynamic dashboard with various sections, including a sidebar, header, and main content areas, using modern CSS techniques.

## Live Demo

## Key Features
- **Grid Layout:** The entire dashboard layout is structured using CSS Grid, allowing for clean and responsive design. Grid is used for the sidebar, header, and main content sections, with further nesting to manage child elements like navigation, user info, projects, and announcements.
- **Nested Grids:** Grids within grids are used for complex layouts, such as the sidebar navigation, the search bar in the header, and the main content sections for projects and announcements.
- **Customizable Design:** The design is customizable, utilizing various external assets such as fonts from Google Fonts, color palettes from Tailwind, and icons from Material Design Icons.

## What I Learned
- Effectively using CSS Grid to manage complex layouts.
- Nesting grid containers to build out different sections of a dashboard.
- Implementing external assets like fonts and icons to enhance the design.
- Building and organizing a large-scale project with HTML and CSS, focusing on layout and design principles.
- Using flexbox in conjunction with Grid for a fluid and responsive layout.

## Challenges and Solutions
A key challenge was managing nested grids for the different sections of the dashboard, particularly ensuring that all elements were correctly aligned and proportioned. By carefully applying background colors and borders during the layout process, I was able to visualize the grid better and ensure that all components fit seamlessly.

## Future Enhancements
- **Responsiveness:** Although this project wasn't required to be responsive, I plan to make the dashboard fully responsive by adjusting grid tracks for different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Content:** In the future, I would like to implement JavaScript to dynamically populate the dashboard with real data, such as fetching live announcements or project updates.
